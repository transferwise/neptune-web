`yarn add @transferwise/components`

This is a port of our styleguide components to react.

[Documentation and demo can be found here](https://transferwise.github.io/components/)

Heavily a work in progress.

Work that still needs doing:
- Missing styleguide components

## Contributing

Docs will be automatically deployed when merging to master, and a new npm release (with corresponding github release) will be created as well. Be sure to increment the version in `package.json` according to semver.
