This component uses `fetch` API which is not supported on IE11. The `fetch` polyfill is not currently provided with the library to prevent code duplication in users apps that may already have that polyfill. Please make sure you have `fetch` polyfill in your app if you intend to provide IE11 support.

<LiveEditorBlock code={code} scope={{ Upload, Button, IMAGES }} display="vertical" />
<GeneratePropsTable componentName="Upload" />

export const meta = {
  name: 'Upload',
};
