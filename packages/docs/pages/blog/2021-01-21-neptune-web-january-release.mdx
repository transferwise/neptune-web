Welcome to our January release. It’s a bit of a lightweight because of the holidays. More exciting things coming soon!

## New and Improved

### FlowNavigation

<DocLink href="/components/navigation/FlowNavigation">See in action</DocLink>

The FlowNavigation component has had layout issues for a long time - as I’m sure you will have noticed if you ever saw it caught in that awkward screen width between “mobile” and “desktop”.

With the upcoming Wise change, we took the opportunity to refactor the component to improve both the implementation and API. Previously the Wise logo was embedded - now you can pass it in. While it will still default to the Wise logo we recommend that you immediately update it to passing in a static logo asset so that you’re ready to switch assets when Wise time arrives.

Check out the Breaking Changes section to see how the API has changed.

### OverlayHeader

<DocLink href="/components/overlays/OverlayHeader">See in action</DocLink>

OverlayHeader has been improved as part of the FlowNavigation work. If you use it, take a look in the Breaking Changes section for updates to the API.

### CheckboxButton

<DocLink href="/components/inputs/CheckboxButton">See in action</DocLink>

Misleadingly named because it’s not a button, this cute little fellow comes in handy when you have a long list of checks in a grid, and each item in the grid is labelled by the row or column header, and so doesn’t need its own visual label.

CheckboxButton was designed as an internal component, but we are aware of people using it directly, and want to better support those use cases. Confusingly, it did actually used to be a button.. In this update we’ve changed it to use an input, which is more accessible. We’ve also made some slight changes to the API (details below).

### Checkbox

<DocLink href="/components/inputs/Checkbox">See in action</DocLink>

As you would expect, Checkbox has been updated to use the new CheckboxButton, so it is now also more accessible, and has some updated focus and hover states.

Oh - and we finally fixed the vertical text alignment!

### Misc

- CheckboxOption no longer requires an `id` property

## Breaking Changes

### FlowNavigation API Changes

**Relevant for you**: If you use FlowNavigation.

There are quite a few changes to the API, so please check out the <DocLink href="/blog/2020-12-15-flownavigation-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</DocLink> for instructions on how to update.

### OverlayHeader API Changes

**Relevant for you**: If you use OverlayHeader.

Once again, there are quite a few changes to the API, so please check out the <DocLink href="/blog/2021-01-22-overlayheader-upgrade-guide">upgrade guide</DocLink> for instructions on how to update.

### CheckboxButton API Changes

**Relevant for you**: If you use CheckboxButton.

We have removed the readOnly prop (as it doesn’t do anything) - use disabled instead.

We added a required onChange handler. Use this in preference to onClick.

We’re using rest spreading, so if you want to add any other handlers to the input, you can. In particular, you should provide `aria-label` to ensure users know what they are checking when there is no associated label.
