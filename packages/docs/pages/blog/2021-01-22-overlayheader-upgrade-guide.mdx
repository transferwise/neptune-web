OverlayHeader has gone through a major refactor, and there are some breaking changes. This upgrade guide will provide the necessary steps to switch to the new version.

## API Changes

<table className="docs-table table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Old API</th>
      <th>New API</th>
      <th>Change</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        avatar: Types.shape({'{'}url: Types.string{'}'})
      </td>
      <td>avatar: Types.element</td>
      <td>
        Instead of an object with a URL, we now expect an{' '}
        <DocLink href="/components/content/Avatar">Avatar</DocLink>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>onClose</td>
      <td>onClose</td>
      <td>No change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>logo</td>
      <td>
        <b>@new</b> We used to display the logo within the component using CSS. We now expect you to
        pass in a logo as an image. You will need to use a light logo if working on a dark screen.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>theme</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>
        <b>@deprecated</b> Used to change logo appearances and borders. Now you can pass and manage
        logo.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>profileType</td>
      <td>-</td>
      <td>
        <b>@deprecated</b> It used to manage the type of Avatar. Since now avatar is provided from
        outside you can decide which type of Avatar youâ€™d like to pass (personal or business) in
        your app.
      </td>
    </tr>

Previously the bottom border was handled by the component, now consumers are required to provide it.
