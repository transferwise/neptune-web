# Neptune Design System – Web

Documentation for building interfaces on web using Neptune components and other resources. Built by TransferWise.

## React components <Version version={componentPackage.version} />

For every Neptune component, we have a page for it with an interactive block where you can edit the code and see a preview of the component live. You can copy this code directly to your project. To learn how to contribute, [go here](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/tree/master/packages/components).

#### Install

```
yarn add @transferwise/components
```

#### Use

```js
import { Button } from '@transferwise/components';
```

## CSS <Version version={cssPackage.version} />

We will have extra documentation on the CSS library soon, in the meantime, here's how you can use it on your project. For more details, [here's the source](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/tree/master/packages/css).

#### Install

```
yarn add @transferwise/css
```

#### Use

In the `dist` directory you can find bundles for the individual components, variables, and other common utilities. Use them as individual components or import the whole library.

```js
// Individual
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/buttons.css';

// Full bundle
import '@transferwise/neptune-css/dist/css/neptune.css';
```

## Usage guidelines

Guidelines on when to use components are shared across all platforms and documented on a [common repository](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune). Please report cross-platform problems and ask questions by creating an [issue](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune/issues).
